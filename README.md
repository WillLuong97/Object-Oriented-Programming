# Object-Oriented-Programming
This repo contains most basic that I gather around the internet about OOP and some source code implementation

## Definition: 
- Object Oritented Programming is the concepts of attributes or properties
- Taking a real world object and represented in code

## Basic Introduction: 
- The four pillar of OOP: 
	 + Polymorphism
	 + Inheritance
	 + Encapsulation
	 + Abstraction

## Abstraction: 
- Only show the necessary details of the object to the user of the objects
- Decouple the user from the underlying implementation

## Inheritance: 
- Allows for code reusability.
- Build a new class that uses features from the old class in addition to its new features

- Subclasses/Extended class/ child class: are classes that derived from an existing class
- Super class/ Parent class/ base class: are classes that get derive from a sub class

## Polymorphism: 
- Poly: means 'many' 
- Morphi: means 'form'

- Determine what kind of functions to run while the program is running
- Call a method on a class if what is calling it is a pointer to the parent object


## Encapsulation: 
- Restrict access of certain properties or methods of our object to whatever it is calling the objects
- getter and setter are used to allow other program to get permission to access and modify private attributes inside the main class
